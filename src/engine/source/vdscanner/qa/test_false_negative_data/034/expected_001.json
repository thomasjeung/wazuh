When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL.

The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to the to the real original dashboard but to the attacker’s injected URL. This issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.",
